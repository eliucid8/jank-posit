# Verilog Posit Implementation
## Author: Eric Liu

### Why?
Real computers use floating point numbers. I was curious about posits and representing fractional numbers in hardware, and I figured that it would be about as difficult to learn to work with floats as posits, so I decided to mess around with posits because they've got some interesting features.

### Features:
- [x] displaying 16-bit posits

- [ ] moving to 32-bit posits (or becoming size agnostic)
- [ ] multiplication
- [ ] addition/subtraction
- [ ] division
- [ ] risc-v integration
